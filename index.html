# Portulaca hatschbachii

Results from the Redundancy Analysis (RDA), based on 154 AFLP fragments potentially under diversifying selection, showing the effects of the environmental variables that shape the genetic structure of Portulaca hatschbachii populations.

Diagram showing the effects of the selected ambiental and spatial variables (full RDA model, R²adj: 0.636, P < 0.001)

### [partial RDA](https://jfmsilva.github.io/Portulaca_hatschbachii/partial_RDA.html)
Diagram showing the effects of the environmental variables after partialling out the effects of the spatial variables (partial-RDA model, R²adj: 0.267, P < 0.001)

Red arrows represent explanatory variables and green lines represent fragments under diversifying selection. Note that only fragments with goodness of fit above 0.5 are shown to aid interpretation. The abbreviations for the environmental variables are as follows: Alt. = altitude; Bio3 = Isothermality; Bio4 = Temperature Seasonality; Bio9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter; Bio10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter; Bio11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter; Bio13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month; Bio15 = Precipitation Seasonality.
